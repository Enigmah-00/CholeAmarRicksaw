## 🎨 Features in Detail

### **Collision System**
- **Player vs Obstacle**: Instant explosion
- **Player vs AI Car**: Both vehicles explode
- **AI vs AI**: Pass through (no collision to prevent traffic jams)
- **Ground Detection**: Proper physics grounding without explosion

### **AI Behavior**
- Random lane selection on spawn
- Speed variation (2-4 units) for traffic diversity
- Forward raycasting (2 unit range) to detect obstacles
- Automatic honking when car ahead is within 10 units
- Pitch-randomized horn sounds (0.5-1.1x)

### **Explosion Mechanics**
- Car breaks into multiple pieces with individual rigidbodies
- Upward force (200 units) + velocity-based directional force (45x)
- Random torque for realistic tumbling
- Pieces tagged as "CarPart" for cleanup
- Time scale manipulation (1.0 → 0.2 → 1.0 over ~1 second)
